# vscode-orgmode
orgmode implementation for VSCode, along the lines of orgmode for SublimeText.

Learning VSCode extensions API and Typescript at the same time.  Basic syntax scopes/highlight works.  Toggling individual checkboxes works.  But there's still a lot to do.  Summaries and references are going to be interesting.

Make sure to `npm install` to pull all the required node modules.  Open folder in VSCode and hit F5 to get extension running in debug mode.  Select OrgMode language for the untitled document and start experimenting.
